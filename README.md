# afl_api
A simple Rest_api which providing the statics of all [AFL](https://www.afl.com.au/) (Australian Football League) players. 
## Why : 
As a fan of AFL, I was looking for a solution to access detailed player statistics and integrate them into a website afterwards. 
I took the bull by the horns and decided to create an api by myself. 

I implemented different filters to select the desired data. There is also the possibility to group the data by categories. 

Further documentation will follow. 
## Technlogies used : 
* [Django](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/)
* [Django_rest_framework](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
* [django-filter](https://github.com/carltongibson/django-filter/tree/master) to create data-filters
* [Postgresql](https://www.postgresql.org/) for the database
